Programming &amp; Scripting module project on Fisher's Iris data set

### Summary 
Ronald Fisher 1936; one of the first models of statistical classification.  The data contains 50 samples of three types of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) measured along four variables - the measurements in centimetres of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.  "Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other".- Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set] <br>

While researching for this project I found a blog detailing some exercises (albeit in R) for this data set that I've borrowed as a guideline for some scripts I need to write - Link [https://joelkuiper.eu/R-workshop] <br>

###### These exercises include:
1.  Select only the rows of the Virginica flowers and assign it to virginica <br>
2   Select only the Sepal Length of the Virginica flowers and assign it
3.  Calculate the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of the Virginica Sepal Length
4.  Select only the numerical columns
5.  Calculate the mean of all the numerical variables

Further online research led me to understand the need to import a library into my Python code to better facilitate these calculations, and I decided to try [Pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
