Programming &amp; Scripting module project on Fisher's Iris data set

### Summary 
Ronald Fisher 1936; one of the first models of statistical classification.  The data contains 50 samples of three types of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) measured along four variables - the measurements in centimetres of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.  "Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other".- Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set]
